# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-20)

**Core value:** A working, submittable IRIS PyProd application, live and functioning end-to-end (ingest → score → classify → persist → dashboard), by the contest deadline
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — IRIS Ingestion Pipeline — Scoring, Classification & Telemetry

## Current Position

Phase: 3 — Dashboard & API
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-20 — Phase 02 complete, transitioned to Phase 3

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Horizontal-layers structure chosen (not vertical MVP slices) given the one-day timeline — build complete technical layers (venue catalog → IRIS PyProd pipeline → dashboard/API → submission) and integrate at the end
- [Roadmap]: Telemetry (TELE-*) folded into the pipeline phase rather than split out — it's an operational side-effect of batch persistence, not independently verifiable without the pipeline already running
- [Roadmap]: IRIS/Docker environment setup has no dedicated requirement ID; it is delivered as enabling infrastructure inside Phase 2 (INGE-01 requires the PyProd production it stands up)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No IRIS environment exists yet — Phase 2 must stand up Docker + IRIS Community Edition from scratch before any pipeline work can run; this is the highest-risk step given the one-day timeline
- Contest deadline is 2026-09-21 (one day from kickoff) — every phase must be planned and executed same-day; no slack for rework
